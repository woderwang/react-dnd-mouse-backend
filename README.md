# react-dnd-mouse-backend
this is fork the lib from react-dnd-mouse-backend

Some platform(like dingtalk(钉钉) version 4.2.xx,the desktop browser) inner webview has bug of drag and drop native event,so react dnd default HTML5 backend can't work.

mouse backend is work great as this way ,but origin lib not provider preview for dragging node,and I add the preview.
